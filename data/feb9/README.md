# Descriptions for Tests from February 9

In this test, we had a tester hold the FTM and UWB wearables and walk on the Anderson lawn in a straight line for 40 meters and then back, with additional turns on the way back
that form 5m x 10m rectangle in the middle of the straight line. Cones were placed every 5 meters on the 40 meter straight line and at each corner of the rectangle.
